# Code Refactoring

What is refactoring?
- Refactoring makes code understandable and easy to extend
- Refactoring makes it quicker to create complicated systems

Why should you refactor?
- Remove excess code so it is easier to understand and modify
- Can better understand other's code
- Eliminate having to remember what old code does
- Write code quicker

What are bad smells?
- Common design problems
- Bad design is normally unclear, complicated or duplicated.

The Bad Smells:
1. Duplicating Code
2. Long Methods
3. Complex Conditional Statements
4. Primitive Obsession
5. Indecent Exposure
6. Solution Sprawl
7. Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
8. Lazy Classes
9. Switch Statements
10. Combinatorial Explosions
11. Oddball Solutions
